greetings, desert corner,
a haven of peace, work and inspiration,
Where the invisible stream of my days flows
In the bosom of happiness and oblivion.
I am yours â€” I have exchanged a vicious court for Circe,
Sumptuous feasts, amusements, delusions
On the peaceful noise of the oak trees, on the silence of the fields,
On idleness free, a friend of reflection.
I am yours-I love this dark garden
With its coolness and colors,

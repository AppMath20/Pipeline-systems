greetings, desert corner,
a haven of peace, work and inspiration,
Where the invisible stream of my days flows
In the bosom of happiness and oblivion.
I am yours â€” I have exchanged a vicious court for Circe,
Sumptuous feasts, amusements, delusions
On the peaceful noise of the oak trees, on the silence of the fields,
On idleness free, a friend of reflection.
I am yours-I love this dark garden
With its coolness and colors,
this meadow, covered with fragrant ricks,
where the bright streams in the bushes are noisy.
Everywhere before me are moving pictures:
Here you can see the two lakes of the azure plain,
Where the fisherman's sail turns white sometimes,
Behind them a row of hills and fields are striped,
Scattered huts in the distance,
On the wet banks of the wandering herds,
The smoky barns and mill krylati;
There are traces of contentment and work everywhere
